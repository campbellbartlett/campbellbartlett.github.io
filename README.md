# [Campbell Bartlett - Github pages]()

This is my Github pagesd website. Created as a project to learn more about Bootstrap, Github pages and web development in general.


## Download and Installation

To begin, choose one of the following options to get started:
* [Fork, Clone, or Download](https://github.com/campbellbartlett/campbellbartlett.github.io)

## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the website in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
