              The site is open sourced and I'm keen for more contributers. I know the best way to improve the

                <div class="mb-3">We required a process for syncing the metadata (configuration) we had on the server

                  each users device in the field,
                  so that when field work was sent out to
                  the a users device, it could be displayed correctly. Prior to this project, each table in the metadata DB was
                  being synced via XML and SOAP endpoints.
                  This project included designing and implementing a method for generating a SQLite database, based off different tables
                  in
                  the production Oracle database and
                  deploying it automatically to devices.

                </div>
                <div class="mb-1">We aimed to design the system in a way that would allow the process to be generic
                  enough that adding new tables or columns to

          <div class="mb-3">An <a href="http://www.iipher.com/">iPad iOS app</a> for Simultaneous Interpreters to use
            as a tool to
            assist when interpreting small - medium sized meetings.
            I developed the app on my own whilst working at Congress Rental, teaching myself everything I needed to
            know. The app
            is used by interpreters all around the world and generates around 9x the cost of running the app each
            month.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">The app has a Python (Flask) API and a Swift front-end. Users are authenticated via two
            factor
            authentication using Nexmo and
            calls are made via Twilio.
          </div>
          <div>As well as developing the app I also created the app's website and managed deployment of the app to
            the Apple App Store.

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Python, Flask, AWS, Docker, Bootstrap</div>
          <div class="mb-3">A semester long project with Macquarie Bank Data and Analytics team and Macquarie University.
            I lead a group of students, tasked with building a prototype that would automate the management of Macquarie Banks
            Big Data algorithms.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">The system was to be configurable to run different algorithms at different regular intervals,
            (daily, weekly, monthly etc) and to connect to different data-sources to collect data.
          </div>
          <div>The project was hosted on AWS and run in a Dockerised environment, which allowed Macquarie Group to host it 
            on their own internal infrastructure after the project was completed.

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Python, Flask, SQLite, XML</div>
          <div class="mb-3">During my time as a McDonald's Restaurant manager, stocktakes were completed on paper
            (usually about 20 A4 sheets!).
            This process would take hours and was prone to data entry mistakes.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">Sick and tired of completing these huge manual stocktakes I wrote a simple Python web
            application for completing the stocktake.
            Once a stocktake was complete, it would produce an XML file that was imported into the back-office PC.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">The application was used across the 5 restaurants owned by the Owner/Operator of the
            Franchise I worked
            for. Parts of how it worked
            were used to develop an official stocktake website by McDonald's Head Office.
