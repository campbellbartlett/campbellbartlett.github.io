                  so that when work was sent to
                  the device, it could be displayed correctly. Prior to this project, each table in the metadata DB was
                  being synced via XML and SOAP endpoints.
                  This project included creating a method for generating a SQLite databased based off different tables
                  in
                  the production Oracle database and

                <div class="mb-1">We aimed to design the system in a way that would allow the process to be generic

          <div class="mb-3">Sick and tired of completing these huge manual stocktakes I wrote a simple Python web
            application for completing the stocktake.
            Once a stocktake was complete, it would produce an XML file that was imported into the back-office PC.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">The application was used across the 5 restaurants owned by the Owner/Operator of the
            Franchise I worked
            for and parts of how it worked
            were used to develop an official stocktake website by McDonald's Head Office.

            This was also one of my first projects and was a huge learning opportunity for me. I kept a copy of the
